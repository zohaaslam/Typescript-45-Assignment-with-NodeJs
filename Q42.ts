//Q42:Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


function show_magicians(magicians:string[]){

    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name))

}


function make_great(magicians:string[]){

    return magicians.map(name => `The Great ${name}`)
}


let magicians_name : string[] = ["Herry Poter","Jenny","Mario"]
  

let great_magician = make_great(magicians_name)

show_magicians(great_magician)
