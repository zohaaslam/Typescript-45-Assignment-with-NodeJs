//12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let arr:string[] = ["Hadiya","Ayzal","Fatima","Abrish"];

let message:string = "How are you dear?";


console.log(arr[0] + " " + message);
console.log(arr[1] + " " + message);
console.log(arr[2] + " " + message);
console.log(arr[3] + " " + message);
